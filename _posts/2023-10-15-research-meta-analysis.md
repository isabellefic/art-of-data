The research study that I chose to analyze is about the impact that peanut consumption in infancy has on developing a peanut allergy as a toddler. The researchers that worked on this study were mostly from King’s College, the University of Southampton, University of California, San Francisco, and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. There are also some researchers from a company based in North Carolina that helps with clinical trials.

The researchers were interested in this data and conducted this study because peanut allergies are becoming increasingly prevalent and peanuts are the leading cause of anaphylaxis and death due to food allergy. Guidelines in the United Kingdom and the United States initially recommended avoiding allergenic foods during infancy and pregnancy; however, both recommendations were withdrawn after studies failed to show that avoiding the allergenic foods prevented allergy development. Thus, the question whether consuming allergenic foods in infancy prevents allergy development remained unanswered. This trial aimed to answer whether the early introduction of peanuts served as primary (targeting people with no reported allergy) and secondary (targeting people already with a reported allergy) prevention in developing or worsening a peanut allergy.

This study was funded by grants from institutions in the United Kingdom: the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, Food Allergy Research and Education, and many others. The study was also funded by the National Peanut Board, which [“strive[s] to help America’s 7,000 peanut-farming families improve their production practices.”](https://nationalpeanutboard.org/about-us/) This could be a potential conflict of interest. Two of the researchers also had potential conflicts of interest: one reported to hold stocks in a pharmaceutical company and another received study materials from Meridian Foods, a company that produces nut and seed butters. The peanut snacks that were fed to the infants in the study were also provided by Osem at a discounted rate. Osem is affiliated with Bamba, who manufactures and sells peanut snacks. Perhaps they would hope that the research showed that consuming peanut snacks at an earlier age prevents allergies; this could boost the sales of their items.

The null hypothesis in this experiment is that the early introduction of peanuts into a diet does not have any impact on the development of a peanut allergy. The alternative hypotheses are that the early introduction of peanuts into a diet provides protection from the development of a peanut allergy or that the early introduction of peanuts into a diet worsens the likelihood that a child will develop a peanut allergy. In this study, the scientists hypothesized that the early introduction of peanuts into a diet **would provide** protection from the development of a peanut allergy.

The data collected in this experiment was the number of children with and without a peanut allergy at 60 months of age. In order to determine whether or not the child had a peanut allergy, the wheal size and levels of IgE, IgG and IgG4, peanut-specific antibodies, were tested. At the end of the study, the data showed that a larger percentage of the children who avoided peanuts had developed a peanut allergy. Below is an image of some of the graphs from the paper that show the percentage of children who developed a peanut allergy in each of the groups (those who initially had a peanut allergy vs those who did not).

The data set references many studies and scientific articles, all of which are linked at the bottom of the study and are available to the public. While there are a few conflicts of interest in terms of funding and the background of the researchers in the study, it does not appear that publish or perish had an enormous effect on this study. Since there were many researchers from many different institutions, “publish or perish” likely would not have impacted every researcher in the same way, as it could have if they were all working for the same company and wanted their research to make a particular conclusion.
